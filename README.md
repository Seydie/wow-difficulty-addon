# Instance Difficulty Warning
A World of Warcraft addon

## About the addon
This addon is still in development. I never worked with LUA before, so this will be a little side project.
The addon will give a pop-up message when entering a dungeon or raid in the game World of Warcraft. Mostly of the time I forget to switch the difficulty of the instance. This addon will be a reminder to check the difficulty when entering an instance.
